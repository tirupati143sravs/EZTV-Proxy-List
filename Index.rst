# EZTV Proxies

Perhaps the easiest way to access the site is through EZTV proxies. A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients looking for resources from other servers. When accessing EZTV through a proxy server, external observers only see that you are connected to the proxy server and do not see that the proxy server is transmitting EZTV data to you.
EZTV proxies are sometimes mistaken for EZTV mirrors. Mirror 1337x is just a clone of the source site with a different domain name and servers. The EZTV proxy server, on the other hand, is a separate site that makes it easy to connect to the original EZTV, as well as often to other websites.
In practice, it doesn’t matter if you connect to EZTV through a proxy server or use an EZTV mirror, as they both provide about the same degree of privacy.
